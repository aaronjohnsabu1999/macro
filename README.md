# Megastructure Assembly via Collaborative Robots in Orbits (MACRO)

This repository contains simulation code accompanying the paper *Scalable Techniques for Autonomous Construction of a Paraboloidal Space Telescope in an Elliptic Orbit* by Aaron John Sabu and Dwaipayan Mukherjee.

## Overview

MACRO provides tools to simulate autonomous formation flying of multiple spacecraft for the construction of a large parabolic mirror while in orbit. The code implements formation maneuvers, attitude consensus and auction based allocation strategies used in the publication. Generated plots and animations from sample runs are available under the `results/` directory.

<!-- ## Abstract

It is well acknowledged that human-made technology is not always at par with human curiosity, and an example is the inability to send large telescopes to outer space despite their higher resolution and less atmospheric interference. In this paper, we develop a framework for autonomous in-orbit construction using spacecraft formation such that a large telescope can be built in an elliptic orbit using multiple spacecraft. We split this problem into four steps for converging the position and attitude of each spacecraft at predefined values around a central spacecraft. Each spacecraft performs attitude synchronization with its neighbors to match its three degrees of freedom in orientation as a parabolic mirror. Simulations validate our proposed methods and the paper concludes with an open possibility of using other techniques to improve upon existing results. -->

## Installation

The project requires Python 3. Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main simulation entry point:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Simulation output will be written to HTML files in the working directory. 
Adjust parameters in `src/main.py` to explore different scenarios.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` – Python modules implementing the simulation
- `results/` – sample output generated by the authors
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
